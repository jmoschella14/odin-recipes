    <h1>Steak</h1>
    <img src="steak.jpg" alt="Steak">
    <p>The Bone In Ribeye steak is a wonderful juicy cut that will be baked in the oven (or air fryer) and then seared to perfection.</p>
    <p>The recipe will be a precombined Kinders seasoning.</p>
    <p>This method has the abiltiy to be cooked in most kitchens. One extra tool will likely need to be purcashed but it is worth the small investment. The steak is baked in the oven and then seared in a pan on the stovetop with a meat press. Lastly, the steak rests for a few minutes to allow the middle to cook a little longer without overcooking the steak.</p>
