    <!-- Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe. -->

    <p>
        Ground turkey is cooked on the stovetop and then combined with a gluten free fusilli pasta to create a wonderful dish.
        <br><br>
        The dish uses a simple combination of a prepurchased seasoning at Trader Joe's which is also where the gluten free fusilli is available.
        <br><br>
        When the water reaches a boil, the ground turkey is cooked on the stovetop. When the ground turkey is brown, the temperature drops and 3/4 of the sauce is added to simmer while the pasta is finished. When the pasta is finished, it is strained and receives the 1/4 of the sauce remaining. The pasta and the ground turkey is combined in a large dish ready to be served!
